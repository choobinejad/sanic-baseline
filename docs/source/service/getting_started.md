# Why This?

### A great project...

A great project has docs, tests, and supports your security and connectivity 
requirements out of the box. This project is that, for me. And, I hope, for others.

But it can be cumbersome and boring to get all that stuff working and organized with
every project. Sanic-baseline attempts to put all those basics in one place.

### What's in the box?

- A RESTful web service, with Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Code docs
- Secure server configuration:
  - CORS support
  - TLSv1.2 enforced 
  - Self-signed certificate authority, with server and client certs

### Quickstart

`python service/run.py`
